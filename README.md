# Description
This is a mod for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord that lets you view your game data on an external dashboard.
When the mod is loaded it sets up a local WebSocket server and pushes updates to connected clients.
The client is a Blazor WebAssemmbly app that connects to the local server and listens for updates.
No data is sent outside your system, the browser downloads the client code and runs it locally.
